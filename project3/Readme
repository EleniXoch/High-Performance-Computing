--Convolution Filter Implementation--

Project 3)

'h_Filter' our filter for convolution (randomly initialized) 
'h_Input'  image to implement convolution

program runs in CPU too in order to validate and compare GPU results

Summary:
	-allocate memory for CPU(malloc), cudaMalloc
	-cudaMemcpy HostToDevice to d_Filter and d_input
	-measuring execution time of the two kernels using cudaEventCreate, cudaEventRecord
	-cudaMemcpy DevicetoHost
	-measure difference between execution and accuracy
	-free all the allocated memory for CPU(free), cudaFree


Different versions of code: 

	2) simple implementation
	4) experimenting with grid, block sizes
	6) double effects on accuracy
	8) padding as cure to divergence
